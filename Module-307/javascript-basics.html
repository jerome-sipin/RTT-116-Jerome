        // !!!! best practice is to always use let when defining variables and only 
        // use var when you know you need it globally avalable to the document.
        // you have to have a reason why it should be global. 

        // var becomes a global variables accessable by any fnction 
        // in the document
        var a = 10;
        var b = "String";
        var c = true;

        function abc(){
            // let scope this variable to the containing {}
            let x  = 10;
            var y = 20;
        }

        // x is not available here because it is confined inside the above function
        // y IS available here because it was defined as a var, which is globally 
        // available to the document

        abc();

        console.log("hello world");
